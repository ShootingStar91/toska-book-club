# 📚 Toska Book Club

A _vibe-coded_ book club app for small book clubs.

The app has three phases of a **voting cycle**:

- Suggestions: All users can submit one book suggestion
- Voting: All members give votes
- Results: Results are shown.

The cycles are automatically changed based on deadlines for each phase set by admin.

When results are shown, a voting cycle is completed. Admin can then start a new one. While a cycle is ongoing, admin can edit the deadlines.

When a user first enters the page, they need to either login, or register. Registering requires a secret value, so only book club members can join.

The voting can either be normal or ranking.

- Normal means each user can give one vote to as many books as they like, 1 vote equaling 1 point. User cannot vote for their own book.
- Ranking means that user must drag the suggestions in the order they desire. Top suggestion gets N points where N is the amount of books below it in the order.

If books are tied in the results phase, the program will decide the winner randomly.

**Built using:** React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, Tanstack-Query, Kysely, PostgreSQL, Eslint, Docker, Vite.

Vibe-coded with Claude Code.
